We used the unittest framework to verify the functionality of the ConnectFour game implemented . The tests ensure that the game initializes correctly, handles player moves properly, identifies winning conditions, and correctly handles attempts to place a disc in a full column. The necessary modules and classes are imported, including unittest for testing, Tk from tkinter for creating the GUI, and game-related constants and classes from connect_four.py (python file of main program) . We used this approach to cover critical aspects of the game's functionality, ensuring the game works as intended under various scenarios. The code for the testing is in  the "test" folder.
